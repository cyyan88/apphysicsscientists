                      <p>Schrödinger’s Wave Equation, which gives the position of a particle (electron) at a certain position, was his most important contribution. This is important because the equation was the first to effectively describe the behavior of an electron and can be applied to both physics and chemistry, such as in creating new chemicals and medicines.</p>
                      <p>Schrödinger started seriously researching in 1920, which was post World War I, after serving as an officer. He also researched through WWII, where he escaped to Italy before returning to Italy later in his life.</p>

                      <p>Bohr’s most important discovery was the liquid droplet theory, which said that neutrons and protons behaved like drops of liquid in the nuclei. This was important because it allowed Hahn and Strassmann to later create the atomic bomb, and future scientists to begin research into nuclear physics.</p>
                      <p>Bohr’s research was done after Denmark’s industrial revolution, and partially during World War I. Similarly to Schrödinger, he left Denmark for Sweden then England during WWII, before returning to Denmark.</p>

                      <p>Dalton’s Atomic Theory, which said that all matter was made of the smallest unit atoms, and that the same type of atom had the same mass and properties. This is because knowledge of atoms at this level is the foundation of chemistry, and allowed future scientists to better explore relationships between atoms and conceptualize how atoms worked to create new materials.</p>
                      <p>Dalton’s research corresponded with England’s Industrial Revolution, and wars including the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars.</p>

                      <p>Thomson’s most significant contribution was his cathode ray experiment, which resulted in the discovery of the electron, and the knowledge that they were negatively charged. This is significant because it allowed for additional research using electrons, which led to a greater understanding of electricity and energy.</p>
                      <p>Thomson’s most significant research was done during the late 1800s, which was the period of Victorian England. This period included industrialization, a growing economy, and a more stratified class system.</p>

Moreover, the discoveries gave scientists a better understanding of nuclear physics and do further research into nuclear energy and other current applications.</p>
                      <p>Curie did some of her research during World War I, which was useful because it allowed her to promote the use of portable X-rays, which were based on radioactivity.</p>
